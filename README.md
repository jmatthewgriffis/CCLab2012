We are starting OpenFrameworks in CCLab!
It seems a good time to start loading to GitHub my class work for:

Parsons MFA (Design and Technology)
Fall 2012 semester
Creativity & Computation Lab

Visit <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/user/20132">my OpenProcessing portfolio</a>
to view additional work for this class, other classes, and my personal pursuits.
